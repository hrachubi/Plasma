# Plasma - few simple simulation

## Plasma in B

Simulation of charged particle in magneic filed. Code is very simple, without NumPy library. Velocity of positively charged particle is in X-Y plane, B is perpendicular. A t=0 particle has only a Vx speed !=0

* Units are "normalized" i.e. it is not SI, not meters, columbs, tesla or gaus  

* Code is not optimized - no NumPy, no SciPy, just pure Python + pyplot.

##Future plan
* rewrite with NumPy/SciPy
* add electric field
* example of magnetic mirror
* some 3d example
